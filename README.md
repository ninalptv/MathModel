Laboratory work No. 1

ESTIMATION OF NUMERICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RANDOM VARIABLES AND CONSTRUCTION OF EMPIRICAL LAWS
OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION
 Laboratory task

1. Create a program that performs:
 calculation of statistical characteristics of a random
variable (sample average, variance estimates);
 construction of the empirical law of a random variable;
 extraneous histograms and statistical
distribution functions.
2. Provide for the input of possible values of a random variable interactively and writing them to a file, since these data will be needed to perform the following laboratory operations.


Laboratory work No. 2

STATISTICAL VERIFICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE LAW OF DISTRIBUTION OF A RANDOM VARIABLE USING THE COEFFICIENT OF ASYMMETRY A AND 
EXCESS E
Laboratory task
1. Create a program that checks the hypothesis of the correspondence of the empirical law of a random variable to the theoretical normal law according to the values of the coefficient of asymmetry and kurtosis.
2. The possible values of a random variable are taken from a file recorded using a program from laboratory work No. 1.


Laboratory work No. 3

CALCULATING THE PROBABILITY OF HITTING A RANDOM VARIABLE DISTRIBUTED OVER A NORMAL
 ACCORDING TO THE LAW, FOR A GIVEN AREA 
Laboratory task

1. Create a program that calculates the probability of hitting the random variable under study at the site ( ), the coordinates of which are determined in laboratory work No. 1. 
The results of the calculations are summarized in the table.
To ensure that the results of the calculation can be used in the next laboratory work.


Laboratory work No. 4

STATISTICAL VERIFICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE LAW OF DISTRIBUTION OF RANDOM VARIABLES BY
 THE CRITERION OF CONSENT (PEARSON'S CRITERION) 
 Laboratory task

1. Create a computer program that verifies the hypothesis of the correspondence of the empirical law of the distribution of a random variable to the normal theoretical law. To ensure communication with the program compiled during the performance of previous laboratory work in order to use their results to carry out the necessary calculations. 
2. The results of the operation of the program are summarized in the table.
3. To conclude that the empirical law of the distribution of a random variable corresponds to a theoretical normal distribution (for example, "the distribution is normal" or "the distribution is not normal").

Laboratory work No. 5

STATISTICAL VERIFICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EQUALITY OF THE VARIANCES OF TWO NORMAL 
 GENERAL AGGREGATES 
Laboratory task

1. Create a computer program that verifies the hypothesis of the equality of the variances of two normal general sets of random variables and, the sample data of which should be entered by the researcher in an interactive mode. 
2. Draw a conclusion about the equality of variances (for example, "the variances are equal" or "the variances are not equal").
